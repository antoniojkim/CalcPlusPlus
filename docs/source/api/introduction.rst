Introduction
============

The CalcPlusPlus engine is a mathematics evaluation engine that can take in any string input and parse it into a mathematical expression, ready for evaluation. It is designed to be incredibly robust to syntax and semantic errors. In addition, it is written in high performance C++ code which employs low level BLAS operations to do most of the heavy lifting.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the calculator, simply download the OS appropriate one from the `release list <https://github.com/antoniojkim/CalcPlusPlus/releases>`_ on github.

Inside the package should be an executable called ``calcpp`` which should start up the graphical user interface that is packaged alongside the main CalcPlusPlus engine.

See the `User Interface Guide <interface.html>`_ for more details on the provided GUI.
